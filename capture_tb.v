/*
clk — the simulation clock, toggling every 10ns (20ns period), same as every testbench you've built — this is the heartbeat that all your synchronous logic reacts to on each posedge.
output_trigger — the input you're using to simulate the pulse that would normally come from trigger.v; in the waveform it goes high once early on, briefly, to kick capture out of IDLE and into RUNNING.
sample_en — the input simulating the periodic pulse from rate_div, driven by your repeat (8) loop; the waveform shows it toggling high/low repeatedly, each pulse advancing sample_counter by one during RUNNING.
arm — the input simulating the MCU telling capture to reset and start over; it goes high once near the end of the simulation, which should kick state from FULL back to IDLE.
done — the output flag capture raises once sample_counter reaches MAX_SAMPLES-1 (8, since you overrode it); the waveform shows it going high partway through and then dropping back to low once arm pulses.
